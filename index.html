                <h2>What is Brandlift?</h2>
                <p>Brandlift is a service designed to educate small business owners, new or experienced, through a crash course of design principles. The target audience is made up of users who otherwise have little to no design experience. Brandlift is intended to introduce complicated design topics in a simplistic way. It follows a 5-week subscription that delivers weekly newsletters straight to a subscriber's email, each covering a different topic related to design and tips for improving a business. These newsletters provide an indepth look into each topic, additionaly connecting subscribers to free and easy to use tools/resources. The topics are listed below:</p>

                <h2>Purpose of this Project</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to work collaboratively with other design students to create a mock-up subscription service that could be delivered electronically. In total, five team members were assigned to this task, myself included. The goal was to demonstrate knowledge of web design while taking into consideration aspects such as accessibility standards, user research, and copyright documentation. Below you will find the list of team members, including their assigned roles.</p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to hone my skills in UX research, while still lending a helping hand in the front-end development of it. Therefore, the majority of tasks assigned to me included audience research, user testing, brainstorming solutions to problems, and troubleshooting code. This meant that I spent a good amount of time interviewing users, understanding the demographics, collecting feedback, and presenting potential solutions for problems to my team.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Understanding User Needs</h2>
                <p>Since we were designing services for small business owners, I began by researching demographics. According to a study by Experian’s Business Information Solutions, I learned that the average age for business owners in the U.S. is 50.3 years old. From here, through conversations with local business owners, I came to the understanding that the main reason for them to skip out on owning a website or creating a brand could be narrowed down to two reasons.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>It’s too expensive</strong>. Or atleast seems that way. Many owners assumed that building a website or brand would be too costly, which can be true. Most, however, were unaware of the free tools that can bring the cost down to zero.</li>
                <blockquote>"Just can't afford it, I have enough expenses of my own."</blockquote>
                <li><strong>Complicated and overwhelming</strong>. Even if they wanted to do it themselves, the idea of designing on their own felt intimidating and not something they had time to commit to learning.</li>
                <blockquote>"I can't understand all the fancy terms you guys use, it's too much."</blockquote>
                </ul><br>  
                <p>Taking age and what I learned from interviewing into consideration, I knew that Brandlift needed to be built around three goals:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Information had to be clear and simple, phrased in a way that is personable and encouraging.</li>
                    <li>Our website and newsletters had to be visually engaging without being cluttered and overwhelming.</li>
                    <li>Providing multiple free resources and tools was a must.</li>
                </ol>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Designing the Style Guide</h2>
                    <p>I began applying what I learned to the intial style guide of our project, which would be later edited and expanded on by other team members. As a graphic designer, I spent a lot of time learning about <a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/the-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory/">Colour Theory</a>. With blue and green being <a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/#:~:text=Calming%20colors,also%20make%20you%20feel%20calm.">calming colors</a>, I wanted our design to be based primarily off of these- any oppurtunity that might provide users with a less intimidating feeling while visiting. I then tested the color palette on a dark background to find additional colors which still met <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance.html"> WCAG standards</a>.</p><br>
                    <p>For our font choice, I chose Sarabun for header text and Montserrat for body text. This pairing I felt not only complimented each other but also provided the friendly and professional tone we were trying to achieve.</p>

                <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
                <p>As we continued to make headway with our project, I took charge of user testing both the live website and newsletter. I documented my process and recorded feedback provided to me. Users consisted of <b>3 males</b> and <b>2 females</b>, with an average age of <b>38 years old</b>. All users had no design experience and/or knowledge. This I felt made an accurate representation of our user audience, minus the slight difference in age.</p><br> 
                    
                <p>Each session of user testing was conducted by first reading each user the initial disclaimer that their opinion is correct and they would receive no judgment. Afterward I would gather the data, identify key takeaways and pain points, then present what I collected to my team before proposing solutions. While many small issues were found and addressed, I will focus on two instances in which I helped solve a problem.</p><br>
                <h3>1. The Addition of a Glossary</h3>
                <p>User testing for the first newsletter, <a href="https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?e=[UNIQID]&u=b827796f3e153e045f4c556ac&id=7a00bc329f">"Building Your Brand"</a>, focused on finding how users rated the content’s understandability, visual presentation, and learning outcome, while encouraged to provide any additional feedback. Though the feedback remained mostly positive, user’s pointed out difficulties in understanding certain terms, including “typography” and “color palette”.</p><br>
                <p>After presenting this to my team, I charged myself with writing the content for our solution, the addition of a glossary page. To do this I highlighted each word user's struggled with and wrote my own definitions for them while following the personable and friendly tone already established.</p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>2. Visual Revamp</h3>
                <p>User testing for what is now an older version of our live site proved to be beneficial and insightful. This time around, users were tasked with rating our site in two categories: user-friendliness and visual design. Simple navigational tasks were also given to pinpoint any errors or pain points. Small issues, such as issues with contrast, overlapping items, and spacing, were discovered and addressed. One of the larger problems, however, was the lack of a visually engaging design, pointed out by most users.</p>
                <blockquote>"The site feels lacking, information is presented in a monotonous way despite the tone being exciting and personable."</blockquote><br>
                <p>Before bringing this feedback to the team, I researched different websites with similar purposes to gain a better idea of how to improve or design. After taking notes and pulling together examples, I presented the problem and potential solutions. These included the addition of color blocks, images to break up information, and larger text to better grab attention.</p><br>
                <p>From here, our team's visual designers created sketches and implemented them into the layout.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <h3>Greatest Challenges</h3>
                <p>Typically, working collaboratively in a group can come with its own challenges, but I am beyond grateful to have had such a great experience with my team. We each had our own strengths and contributed to the project equally. One of the biggest challenges stems from working in a time of Covid. All of our work had to be done remotely, but this was something we overcame with excellent communication.</p><br>
                <p>Additionally, working in a team of five with as much creative liberty as we had meant that a lot of ideas were bounced off each other. Everyone had their own ideas on what direction we should go in. Gratefully, I can say that in the end, we are all very satisfied with the outcome. 
                </p><br>
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>This project left me with a much deeper understanding of UX research and its significance. Testing often and throughout the design of the product is the only way to keep a user-centered approach. While my role put me primarily in charge of researching, I also spent a good chunk of my time helping code the more creative layouts and solving issues that other team members struggled with. Therefore, I am leaving this project much more confident in my front-end development skills.</p><br> 
                <p>Lastly, practicing my writing skills by creating the content for our <a href="https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=b827796f3e153e045f4c556ac&id=65d62b36e6">“Setting Up Shop”</a> newsletter and the <a href="https://web-design-oswego-art-dept.github.io/collaborative-project-brandlift/glossary.html">Glossary page</a> is something I am happy to have been able to do. Writing is a skill that I am learning more and more is crucial in the field of UX/UI, so I am always looking for more opportunities to improve. That concludes this case study, thank you for reading! </p><br>
