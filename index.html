                <h2>What is Gamify?</h2>
                <p>Maintaining attention, falling asleep, and having an interactive element
                    during lectures are issues that already exist within in-person classrooms. These are made more prevalent with students who are now limited to learning primarily from their computer screen in an environment that can allow for even more distractions. As a result, professors can struggle to keep students engaged and focused.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>This presents the design question: “How might we design an easy-to-adopt way for professors to increase engagement with students who struggle to stay focused?” Gamify is designed to be the solution, designed to do the heavy lifting by adapting the learning experience to one that is much more fun and interactive.</p>

                <h2>Purpose of this Project</h2>
                <p>This project was assigned during a fast-paced 5-week Human-computer Interaction course that emphasized UX methods, designs, and evaluations. I was tasked with framing my own design challenge. From here, I would follow a design process requiring a different deliverable each week. These are listed below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Framing the design challenge</li>
                    <li>Conducting user interviews & creating personas</li>
                    <li>Creating wireframes</li>
                    <li>Creating mockups</li>
                    <li>Creating an interactive prototype</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Framing the Design Challenge</h2>
                <p>The first phase was all about brainstorming. I needed to design a better or new way of doing something through the integration of technology. I began thinking about my experiences as a student and the challenges that came with the pandemic forcing the transition to remote learning. This led me to consider not just how much students struggle, but professors who find a lot of difficulty in getting students engaged. It became apparent that my solution needed to be one that benefits both students and professors alike.</p> 

                    <p>After some trials and tribulations, I deciding on creating an app that could essentially “gamify” topics and lessons for teachers/professors who want to increase engagement. Due to a limited time frame, I decided to focus on the user experience/journey from a professor’s point of view.

                <h2>Conducting Interviews & Creating Personas</h2>
                <p>Conducting interviews allowed for a much deeper understanding of the users I was designing for. I decided to interview both a current student and a professor in order to design with both perspectives in mind. While I know that conducting multiple interviews would be more beneficial, I had to work within strict time constraints. The goal of the interviews was to better define user needs, goals, obstacles, and motivations. Below are some key points I gathered.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>On the topic of remote teaching.
                    </li>
                    <blockquote>"–things can just be time-consuming, sometimes getting a simple response during online lectures feels like pulling teeth."</blockquote>
                    <li>When asked about how they keep students engaged.</li>
                    <blockquote>"It can be difficult and sometimes you just can’t really get around it. There may be topics that you struggle to bring to the students. It’s my obligation as a teacher to make things as accessible as possible, and adapt them where I can when I bring them to the students in a way that can help them."</blockquote>
                    <li>When asked about their goals.</li>
                    <blockquote>"I want to be seen as a mentor, I don’t want to be seen as someone who is just there to regiment them, shuffle them in and out. I personally want to be someone they can look up to, leave a positive impact on their lives, help them with problem-solving and social skills."</blockquote>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>I used this information to put together a persona. This gave me someone to constantly reference throughout the remainder of the design process. </p>

                    <h2>Creating wireframes</h2>
                    <p>Before getting into the look and feel of the app, I decided to take some time to research some similar apps/services. The first one that came to mind was Kahoot. This is a product that already does a fantastic job at creating engagement but I feel could still provide a more game-like experience. This is where I took some inspiration from Jackbox.TV, a similar product but one that leans mostly towards entertainment rather than education. You might find that my design takes inspiration from both of these products in terms of look and ease of use. My goal for this design was to create something simple and as painless as possible. </p><br>
                    <p>After a quick round of user testing, as well as feedback from my professor and colleagues, a few revisions were made. These include minor changes such as utilizing screen space better and making certain functions more clear.

                <h2> Week 4 - Creating Mockups</h2>
                <p>This phase would require me to now consider the overall aesthetics of the app. I carefully considered what font & size to use for legibility while trying to achieve a specific tone. Additionally, I used a consistent color palette that I made sure to test for accessibility purposes according to WCAG standards.

                <h2>Week 5 - Creating an Interactive Prototype</h2>
                <p>Once I had my mockup completed, I transferred everything to InVision. This meant I could conduct more user testing which as a result helped me find some usability issues. For example, I found that I had placed the “back” button on some screens too high and needed to lower it.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <h3>Greatest Challenges</h3>
                <p>Time was easily the biggest challenge for me over the course of this project. While I wanted to spend more time researching, interviewing more users, planning out my design, etc., this class was designed to be more along the lines of a crash course.</p><br>
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>Despite the challenges it brought, the time constraints taught me to work more rapidly in order to meet deadlines without sacrificing too much quality. I have newfound knowledge of how to complete user interviews while avoiding biases, creating user personas, and conducting usability tests. Additionally, I had a lot of fun practicing how to brainstorm and coming up with unique solutions for everyday problems. I look forward to completing more projects like this one. That concludes this case study, thank you for reading!
